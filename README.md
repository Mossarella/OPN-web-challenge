# Web developer challenge : Front End Developer position

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was rapidly prototyped using the Next.js framework with typescript to provide full-stack capabilities and serve as a production-ready successor to a React web app. Furthermore, Next.js’s backend features were also utilized to simulate HTTP GET and POST requests.

Tailwind CSS and ShadCN were used for quick styling and responsiveness. Touch up with a whole new design and interactivity. Enhancing the user experience with both functional and aesthetic improvements. 🔥🔥🔥

#### Basic requirement checklist

- ✔️ A completely new design according to application wireframe. Built with the most robust css foundation. Designed to be scalable for future enhancement in both code and styling wise.
- ✔️ A feature to display all donation amount. And a feature to donate to just what foundation you wish for.
- ✔️ A feature to display a message when the transaction is complete. On the other hand, when a transaction is incomplete (It's unlikely, duh)
- ✔️ The application itself will remember the last donation amount that user have selected with any foundation. Despite they're leaving the site and revisit us the other time.
- ✔️ The MockDB will have new donation/ payment record push in. You can also inspect the console when the donation is complete.
- ✔️ Refactor code
- ✔️ Most of the CSS styling was done using Tailwind classes. I typically use CSS modules for additional configuration on a per-component basis when needed, but in this case, Not required.
- ✔️ A step by step commit message to trace what have been done.
- ✔️ Display exquisitely in most modern browser.

#### Non functional requirement checklist

- 🎯 Fully responsive for various device sizes. Starting at 320px (the lowest screen size to consider).
- 🎯 Helper unit test

#### Additional enhancement to perfect the application

- ⭐ Various quality-of-life improvements, such as little meaningful animations, button states, loading spinner and skeleton (Very spooky 💀).
- ⭐ Error handling and error display for unexpected issues.
- ⭐ Basic form validation to ensure the correct data management.
- ⭐ Catch all 404 page for unmatched routes.
